Automation Setting up Splunk SIEM


The readings touched on the topics of cybersecurity automation and Incident response, when it comes to automation using tools
that and monitor analyze and implement configured responses are becoming key components to enterprise cybersecurity roles. 
The article mentioned the use of tools like security automation and orchestration (SOAR) and robotic process automation (RPA) 
which automate responses to threats. The reporting suggest that automating these task of monitoring for threats is more efficient 
and effective to identifying threats because the amount of threats that could possibly attack a system and expecting a cyber expert
to detect every one is not realistic. 

The automation of IR allows for a more strategic and manageable approach to threats on the system, with automating your network to 
respond to threats you can isolate the infracted network, preventing the further spread on the virus to other parts on the network. 
This protects the system and provides the cyber team to examine the threat without making decisions In a stressful or panicked state 
of mine. Knowing that the network as been isolates provides a sigh of release and limits the scope of damage.
