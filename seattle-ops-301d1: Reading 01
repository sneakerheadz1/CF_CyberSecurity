In this reading, I learned about change enablement within the ITIL framework and the and steps that are included in the 
implementation and execution of change enablement. Change enablement is implementations of the process that are used when 
IT services needs changes to help reflects business needs, this framework typically refers to hardware and software changes 
but should also consider the overall business needs and not just the technological needs. The various layers include establishing
change types, establishing a change authority, and incorporating effective communication and scheduling procedures that allow for
change with minimal friction to clients and the users of their system.
