reading 03- IAM

Today's reading gave a detailed view of what Identity aceesss management is (IAM)
IAM is primarily for entreprise companies and the purpose of having an access management system
is for managing roles and access privileges to individuals that work for the company, this iam 
allows administrators to define users of internal system by varios categories such as user
and add or restrict privliges based on roles or company needs.

Depending on the company needs there are many tools that can be incorporated into IAM management tools
such as API security which is useful for b2b, customer identity and access management for service 
and profile management just to name a few. IAM is benificial to orgs becasue it is a flexible
system that if managed with best practices strengthens internal systemsand benificial in 
organization that can be useful in staying inline with compliance.
