Today's reading was about DNS(Domain Name Server) and the Ubuntu server, 
they both were pretty interesting, it started with learning about the history
of the dns and how the system originated in the 1980 and before that the people
who could actually communicate by using ip address. It really emphasizes how 
important the dns is and it's not really known to many. Beside the history I 
learn about all the behind the scene work that goes into exchanging the ip 
address for actual words and the number of servers involved from the dns to the tld. 
The ubuntu article was more about standing it up but there were some interesting key
takeaways such as even tho its open source it can scale to enterprise levels as a
cost effective option and how it has been a top competitor in working with cloud 
service, so when i actually have a chance to stand mine up i will be able to test its capabilities.
