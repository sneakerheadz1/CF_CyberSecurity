Adding windows data to splunk

Todays reading was on the topic of adding data into splunk from a windows endpoint and some of the
steps involved, one of the key prerequisite of getting realtime data into splunk from windows or 
another server is by installing the universal forwarder onto the host you wish to gather data from.
Some of the benefits of using the universal forwarder on remote host is it provided detailed monitoring 
metrics and it's also scalable. It is recommended to install the forwarder as clean as possible initially
and after instillation then configure to fit the business needs.
