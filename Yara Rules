YARA Rules

Todays reading was on the topic of YARA rules, YARA is a tool that allow you to write rules to find 
malware on the system or network and emails, it essential parse code to and it will identify if the 
code is related to other know malware code that has already been identified.  One of the ways you can 
use YARA is creating key words that if I the word is identified then you can be notified of it as 
possible malware and prevent you from clicking the link or downloading malicious files. Something 
that is important to keep in mind when you YARA and could be disregarded without consistency is changing
or updating YARA rules to change as the malware changes so that the rule applies to the changes.
