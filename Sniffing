Todays reading was on the topic of sniffing, sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing packets that 
are traveling over a network, these packets can be used for various reasons, but attackers typically used packet 
data to attempt to uncover sensitive information that is traveling over the network and held within the packets. 
There are two different types of sniffing active sniffing and passive sniffing. Active sniffing is the active 
injection into the LAN to enable sniffing of the traffic, passive sniffing is essentially sniffing through a hub 
all traffic traveling over a non switched network can be seen on the network.
