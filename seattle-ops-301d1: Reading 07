The reading provided a pretty in-depth information about segmentation and some of the reasons that it 
is implemented. Network segmentation is a way of taking a network and dividing it into individual smaller 
networks, this allows for the administrator of the network to have greater control of the flow of traffic
that happens within the network. Segmenting a network is useful for improving performance
within pockets of the network as well as increasing security by now allowing 
for communication outside of a defined network. 

Network segmentation is implanted a few different ways it can include VLAN configuration or creating
policies and rules within the router interface. It also touched on some concepts that have come about
in regards to the way companies have began to look at what it deems a vulnerability, and their new approach
to zero trust where no one even employees are considered trustworthy therefore tougher restrictions are needed
within enterprise networks to protect company data.
