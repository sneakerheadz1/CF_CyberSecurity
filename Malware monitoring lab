Malware monitoring lab

Todays reading was on the topic of malware deduction and creating a malware lab to gain knowledge and
experience in methods that are being used to obfuscate detection and improving your chance of preventing
that from happening in your personal and professional environment. The article touches of the steps to 
setting labs but also making sure that your environment is updated and patches because if the environment
is not secure then the malware that your are testing can escape to your host machine. 

The lab does not have to be overly sophisticated but should include a router such as pfsense and separate
virtual machines to start your testing. Some of the other tools that can be used to hunt for malware Wireshark,
PeStudio, RegShot / TotalCommanderÂ , and Resource Hacker just to name a few.
