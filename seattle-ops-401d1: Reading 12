Intrusion Detection System

Todayâ€™s reading was on the topic of network intrusion detection system (NIDS), a NIDS is a program that identifies potential
threats and is a vital tool in an enterprise system, this system provides notifications of [otential threats to the system to
allow the system admin to analyze threats and take action. This tool differs from Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) which has
the capability of actually blocking threats that are detected as well as log the alerts that are detected, but the flaw is that
if not configured correctly it will prevent legit programs from accessing the network as well.

The benefit of the NIDS is that it can be configured and has the ability to show you the information inside the packets, and protocol
analysis which looks at the TCP UDP payloads. With there ability to quickly analyze threats allows for quick response to potential
threats to the network.
