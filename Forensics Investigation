Today's topic was on the topic of computer forensics the difference between cyber security and what
a career in computer forensic would entail. Computer forensic investigative security issues, data breaches
as well as cyber crimes, they play a more reactive role, not working to analyze or prevent but to investigate 
a crime to provide feedback on how the crime was executed. The article states that in 2019 there were over 3000
data breaches and that 300,000 different malware programs are created each day. Some the the tools that computer
forensic would use are EnCase, SANS SIFT, ProDiscover Forensic,Volatility Framework and Autopsy.
