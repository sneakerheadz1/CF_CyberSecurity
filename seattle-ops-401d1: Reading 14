traffic mirroring 


Todays reading was on the topic of traffic mirroring, which is the coping of inbound and outbound traffic that is taking
place over another device that are attached to the same network. To mirror traffic through aws you need to establish a 
target device which is the device that will be set up to monitor and a source device from which the traffic is entering 
and exiting. This connection has to be done through either two devices on the same vac or connected through peering.

 There are reasons that you would want to mirror traffic from on device to anther, one reason is if you can keep an open
 eye on the devices that are within your network to analyze the traffic coming in and out to determine threats and possible
 pattern of potential threats. You can combine this mirror feature with a tool like Wireshark or a collection data into a 
 more analyzable format to assess and diagnose network traffic and possible vulnerabilities.
