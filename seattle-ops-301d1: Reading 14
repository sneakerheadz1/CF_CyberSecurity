Today's reading was about SQL structured query language, and what is considered data/ database.
Data could be almost anything if refrence to and object, it could information such as documentation, employment information
customer data, or images and a database is simply the systematic colledtion and storage of data. Sql computing langhuage similiar to
python, javascritp and other computing languages that allows for you to work with relational data tables. A relational data based
is a data table that consist of keys primary and forign keys and those key provide a relationship to other data tables that can be 
queired by using slq commands to request specific data from the tables. sql is used to analyze data in a more effiecnt way with a simple 
human readible computing language.
