Todays readings focused on DevOps, the articles provided insight on what devOps is, some 
discussion on how the idea around the framework was created and the goals of DevOps. DevOps
is a hybrid of what was a previously siloâ€™d departments development and the operations these
two frameworks came together with the goals of creating a system that produced continuous
integration, continuous delivery, continuous testing and continuous monitoring. When first
heard these concepts in relation to DevOps it reminded me of a similar agile or design 
thinking process where the objective is to put services/products In the hand of customer 
asap with the goal of continuing the iteration process throughout the lifecycle of the product.

Infrastructure as code (Iac) was a very interesting concept the idea of packaging virtual
machines or servers up as script for quick and easy deployment was something new to me and 
the Idea is still a bit vague, but on a high level it makes since, instead of having to spend
time or money to implement a hardware or having staff work on different systems you can create
a IaC and allow for deployment of the same systems for different teams, as well having backups
readily available.
