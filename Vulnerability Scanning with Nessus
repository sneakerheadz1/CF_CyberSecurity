Todays reading was on the topics of the differences between vulnerability scanning and 
pen testing, the article states that pen testing goals are to exploit vulnerabilities in 
a system whereas vulnerability scanning seeks to check for known vulnerabilities and 
generate reports based on the findings. The threes factors both depend on is the scope, 
risk and critical assets and the cost and time. Vulnerability scans checks for vulnerability 
in devices and network, it checks firewall, routers and applications. Scanning consists of 
checking logs and running programs to see what systems are open and have a potentials to be
exposed by a possible pen tester or actually attacker. While both are important in the space
of cyber security It is important to point out the differences in why they are used and what their goals are.
