the reading for today spoke to what an activce directoy is, the first article spoke at a high level of what AD DS is in its
relaction to AD and this when people are speaking about AD they are referring to AD DS, it also spoke to weather AD should be 
considereed an database or a directory to me it seems like it could be considered as both because it emcompasse both fuctions but 
based on the reading definition they look at it as a directory because how its structured.

the Secound article was also a high level artical and provided some basic understanding of the structure of AD
and how it starts at the OU level and travels downward to smaller parts, the OU has the most hierarchy and other nodes travel 
down from there weather its goups, user, devices ect...
