Routing reading

This reading spoke in a detailed way about routing, what it is how its used and the benifits of different types of routings.
routing is a process that allows over layer 3 of the osi model data(packets) to be tranfered over a network, this is done by 
either one of three ways static(manually adding routes to the routing table), default also manual(this send all packets to a 
specific router, no matter the route), and dynamic most commonly used (automatically makes adjustments to the route of packets
based on the state of each routes.)

The articles also touched on a routing protocol called OSPF which stands for (Open Shortest Path First), this is an internal internet 
prtocol which allows for network connections within a internal private system and does not allow communication with a WAN network. there
is more than once version and OSPF Version 3 is a updates version that can be used with both ipv4 and ipv6 providing more capabilities but
still is not the most scalable option for routing.
