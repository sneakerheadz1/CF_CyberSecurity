The reading for today touched on the topics of Azure cloud and Azure Identity management within
the Active Directory. Azure is Microsoft based cloud computing services there services range from 
using there data centers for storage and backups so there is less need for organizations to possess
their own hardware, to also hosting web servers through the Microsoft cloud platform. Azure can be
used to host virtual machine all the way to creating and deploying applications, this also included
the ability to manage directories.

The Identity management service in the cloud allows for the benefits of the AD that was on-perm to
be adapted to the could based format in the cloud allowing for the users within the network to access
enterprise systems in order to manage system for a sys admin, as well as employees to log into their 
individual workstations remotely. This cloud Active acts similar to the traditional AD allowed for
creation of users, groups and setting different levels of restrictions but with some added security 
process for the cloud that needs to me implemented by the administrator to be active.
