Ethics


The first article I choose was the topic of ethics in the workplaces and Microsoft employees standing up for immigrant
workers and against Microsoft working with ICE to separate families, removing children from their parents. Microsoft 
executives stated that they were not working directly with the government, one of the quotes that stood out was  “As 
the people who build the technologies that Microsoft profits from, we refuse to be complicit. We are part of a growing
movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful 
technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm.” this quote is a key reason I love the 
tech space the employees banded together to raise money for non-profits in support of legal fees associated with the 
families involved in such a cruel act by the US government. 

The risk for cyberattacks in self-driving cars, with the advancement of technology and push for more envionemtntal
friendly cars, the number of self-driving vehicles are expected to increase dramatically, and with the increase of
more tech in cars increase the possibilities of cyber-attacks. The article stated that government regulations may 
not be enough to thwart cyberattacks and I agree, technology moves much faster than the governments so managing 
cyber attacks will be a problem that the private sector will have to invest in to help ensure continued safety.
