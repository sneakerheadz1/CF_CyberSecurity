Diversity 

Todays readings surronded the topics of diversity and gender gaps, the articles shed some 
lite on some known gaps in the tech industfy but it provided some statictics and some history
that was interesting, such as the rate of women enrolled in cs in the 80s which was 37% and how by
2016 that number had dropped dramatically to only 18%, which is tragic. the interesting point that
was made was the corealtion to gamingwhich when you think of bout it has some relevance, to think 
that early computer systems were used for games and the games were marketed to meis an interestig
perspective, as to why in in the early days of computing boys/men would gravitate to computing 
more than girls/woman and how the gap could widen.
