The reading for today touched on the topics of DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) and looking into what defines a server. 
Starting with DMZ refers to a area or zone within a subnetwork that is left venerable. This is intentionally 
done with the intentions of providing a more secure network for the local network. Typically you will 
create a DMZ within your network infrastructure to protect against attacks on your local network devices 
and database, since the DMZ is the most venerable area of the network whenâ€™ if its attacked hopefully there 
are none of your internal devices connected to the servers or devices intended to designated to the DMZ,
therefore if the attackers they to bypass into more internal devices they will be blocked by the secondary l
ines of defense, firewalls.

The next article touched on servers, servers are useful for a number of different thinks from allowing
to create internal web pages to help manage data on the network, server can be both hardware and software
that works together manages files, it also touched on the differences between the older less secure HTTP 
port 80 and the newer version HTTPS port 443 that handles ssh encryption.
