SQL / XSS Injection

Todays reading was on the topic of scripting injection, there are two common approached to this sql injection and
cross site scripting. Sql injection is when attackers uses commands associated with the database through input fields,
that trigger unintended Sql responses grating the attacker access to information that is unauthorized, was to mitigate
against this type of attack is to sanitize user inputs, preventing users from users from input raw sql commands as inputs. 

Cross scripting is using vulnerabilities in javascript to by injecting malicious javascript code into a webpage that alters
the pages behavior,  cross scripting can be used to make simple changes to how the web site functions to accessing credentials 
and gaining access to sensitive information. The ways to militate against cross scripting is similar to sql injection, developers
need to place validation parameters into their code the validates user input and provides and error to the users instructing 
them to input correct field information. This validation process will prevent malicious commands from passing through the code.
