Reading Threat hunting

Todays reading was in the topic if threat hunting, threat hunting is the proactive process of analyzing
all the systems and devices on the network in search of possible threats, it is not the same as someone 
using Siem or being reactive. A threat hunter uses their tools such as Rita and other to seek out possible 
vulnerabilities in the system to confirm or deny that the system has no current threats, they are important 
because the are working to constantly prevent attacks before they are present on the system testing the system
and regularly looking for irregularities and afterwards repots on the finding.
