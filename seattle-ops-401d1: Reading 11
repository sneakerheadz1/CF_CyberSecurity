Wireshark

Todayâ€™s reading was about the tool Wireshark, which is used to scan and capture packets sent over networks.
This tool can be used to capture the information within thoes packets such as the credentials contained inside
those packets such as passwords and usernames. To obtain this information through Wireshark you need to be able
to gain administrative privileges but there is a way that you can tell the tool you want to accept all the packets
that are identified in the scan through promiscuous mode. 

The Wireshark tools work by using network cards and combining them with other tools span ports and npcap allowing
you to see packets on wifi or that are not directly sent through ports connected to your switches. wireshark encompasses 
a number of feature that allow for some decryption and using those feature to decrypt passwords.
