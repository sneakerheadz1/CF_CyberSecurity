Microsoft Active Directory

In todays reading I learned about active directory and its many used Active Directory is a tool
created by Microsoft in the 1990â€™s and acts primarily as a systems management tool that allows
those with access the ability to manage the software and the use ability of the users listed in
the actual directory. Active directory was the first of its kind to be able to maintain active 
up to date records in the data base but updating all the servers when changes were base to data.

As you dive deeper active directory gets more complex than just a management system, also its still
primarily allows management of systems the layers of how its done get more complex, the understanding 
of forest, trees, groups and domains is understandable at a high level but would like to dive a
little deeper to understand it at a conceptual level.
