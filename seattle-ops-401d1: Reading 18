Todayâ€™s reading was on the topic of OWASP threat modeling what it is why is used and ways it could go wring. 
Threat modeling is the process of identifying, communicating and mitigating occurrences in protecting something
of value, in reference to application it is mainly data. Threat modeling is applied to networks, software, 
applications and systems  and can take place at any step within the development cycle. 

Threat modeling included a framework that are commonly followed, what area the threats, what are the concerns
to prioritize and how to test and validate threats. This framework helps to set best practices when in the product
development process to assist in creating secure code, identify vulnerabilities and balance risk with usability. 
When using any modeling techniques its is essential that documentation is taking place throughout the steps to
have a record to reference and should be help as a living document that is updates over time.
