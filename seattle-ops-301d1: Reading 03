Todayâ€™s reading introduced a few new concepts for me to understand endpoint devices, endpoint agents, and the
hardening of operating systems. Endpoints are the devices at the end of a network connection ranging from desktops 
to phones and printers and with the changing of the workspace environment we have to think about more than a traditional 
off workspace environment and start to look at the changing landscape of the new working conditions. 
Endpoint agents provide options and a number of steps for protecting endpoint devices and some considerations
for choosing the best solution that works for your company and work environment. Establishing real-time monitoring 
while leaving a light footprint and not using all the resources of the device are just a few subjects to consider when
thinking of agents.
The hardening of devices is more of a protection for the company and also establishing measures for protecting people from their selves,
with the intention of limiting the use and functionality of the devices to the workload and task related to their responsibilities. 
This is ever more important with more people working remote and possibly leaving their devices in places that may not be as protected as a
traditional work building.
