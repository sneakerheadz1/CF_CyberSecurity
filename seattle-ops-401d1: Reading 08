Today's reading was focused on data loss prevention, data prevention is primarily the use of tools and having policies
and procedures in place to prevent the loss of sensitive information. DLP software is an important measure in preventing
data loss, by deploying the appropriate software it could prevent and monitor your systems and data that is handled within
the network based on configurations. These software can add to or include firewall features, but the software alone is just
one step in the DLP process, there should also be some policies in place that practice data transfer and data handling best practices. 

Besides compliance reasons there are other reasons that companies and individuals should think about data loss prevention, 
there are both financial and personal repercussions from data loss, this impacts companies reputation and timely restoration
process if you become a victim of identity theft.
