reading CIA TRIAD / Hashing

Today's reading were about the CIA Triad and what are hashes. To  begain CIA represents Confidentialiaty
Integrity and Avaliability and are part of the foundatoin of information security and key elements of the 
NIST CSF. In the context of the cia triad condifentially means protecting the privacy of information and 
there are a number of reasons that information should be kept private from keepting consumer data private
to protecting intellectual property safe.One of the ways data can be kept confidential is through encryption. 
The next is Integrity and this represents preventing data from beingtampered with at rest or in trasit, the 
should contain acurate data and should be free of all unauthorized changes and lastly is Avaliability when 
means that data should always be avaliable and measures should be in place to ensrue this in unforseen events
such as natural diasters or server attacks data should be backed and able to be restored. 

The next topic touched on the topic of hashing, and how the work hashing can see to be in the same family as 
cryptogrophy but a not nessearily considered encryption or decryption. Different forms of hasing perform the
same functiuon of hashing but in different ways the are a number of hashing categories from MD family to the
SHA family, hashes takes a block of data and through a cryptpgraphic function produces a string of varios 
charcters that act as a key to that block of data.
