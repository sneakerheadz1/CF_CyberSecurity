The topic of the reading was VPN ( Virtual Private Network) and it provided a high level summary 
of not what a vpn was directly but the was it could be used and how to pick a vpn of your in the market for vpn. 
This article touched on vpn tunneling which is the process of “encapsulating” and encrypting data from location to
another so that the data is unrecognizable to anyone trying to see or possibly steal the data that you are sending. 

They also talked about vpn splitting this is the process of were you can break your internet traffic up depending on your objectives, 
if your were wanting to send private data you can do that through the vpn service but also on that same network send send data or use 
the devices through normal channels. Some of the topics I would like to get more details on that were mentioned in the reading was what
are VPN actually are they a virtual ip address or server help by a company or hardware that allows them to operate as well as dive a bit 
deeper into the vpn protocols.
