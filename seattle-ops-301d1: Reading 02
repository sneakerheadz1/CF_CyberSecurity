Todayâ€™s reading game provided a refresher on networking while introducing some newer concepts 
to networking such as CAN and PAN Networks just to name a few it was interesting to learning small 
and minimal networks can be expanding to how large networks can be. Another topic that interested me 
is the Mesh typologies and got they are all connected and learning what makes them vulnerable and thinking 
through way to prevent SPOF and how to test different networks against different types of possible failures,
overall this was a good read and explained the information in really digestible ways.
