Today's reading was on the topic of Metasploit, Metasploit is one of the many tools that are native to a Kali 
Linux machine, and is used as a penetration tool, making hacking seem less complicated, therefore becoming an 
intricate tool in vulnerability exploits and used widely among blue and red teamers. Metasploit integrates
well with other tools such as Nmap which helo highlight some of the reasons this is a popular tool, using 
Metasploit you can create, manipulate, payloads point it at a target machine, and let it work. once the payload 
has been executed, you can use a meterperter session to shell into the target computer and possibly execute 
different attacks or just gather more information for research. Metasploit is a powerful tool and something 
that security professionals should be familiar with because there is a good chance that you will need to use 
it or understand its capabilities at worse.
